In this repository, I explore the effectiveness of transfer learning with the ResNet18 architecture on the Imagenette dataset. Following a systematic approach, I first preprocess the dataset by selecting five classes of interest and splitting it into train, validation, and test sets. Then, I evaluate the performance of the pre-trained ResNet18 model on the test set and calculate its accuracy. Subsequently, I modify the pre-trained model by adjusting its head and backbone layers to suit the specific task at hand. After training the modified model on the train/validation sets, I assess its accuracy on the test set and compare the results with those of the pre-trained model. Through detailed analysis, I provide insights into the differences observed between the two models, shedding light on the impact of architectural modifications on model performance. This repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding the nuances of transfer learning in the context of computer vision tasks using popular architectures like ResNet18.
